# Node_Js


## be sure that you installed node & npm by:
- node -v 
- npm -v

Node.js, with its V8 engine, asynchronous architecture, and vast collection of NPM packages, empowers developers to create lightning-fast and highly scalable web applications.
By relying on an event-driven, non-blocking model, Node.js handles multiple connections concurrently without waiting for previous operations to complete.
